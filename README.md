Application in Streamlit that leverages OPEN AI API to operate semantic search for the retrieval of information from financial news articles.

It is crucial to install in your own environment "Requirements.txt" with the command on your bash:

pip install -r Requirements.txt

I advise to first open and understand the notebooks inside the folders "1_text_splitting", "2_FAISS_index" and "3_text_sourcing". 
This will create a basis to later proceed. 

It is needed to run the file "main.py" to showcase the application. Apply the following command inside your environment:

streamlit run main.py

This represents a first step for the creation of an application that will satisfy needs of financial professionals across multiple jobs.
